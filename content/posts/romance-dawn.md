I hope this title will spark a memory in many of you. The dawn of an adventure is never as poetic as we want it to be: no sea monsters, no soundtrack, no open sea in front of us and no treasure to go for. The only thing that makes it worthwhile is looking back at it at the end of the journey; but for that, we'll have to wait.

Enough of the philosophical talk and let's explain who am I and what is this blog for.

## whoami
I'm Devrar and honestly I don't know what much else to say about me, but maybe I can start from what I'm interested in.

- __chess:__ one of my goals is to understand as much as possible of the complexity behind chess (and every other board game actually). At the time of writing this, I'm in a period of break since I wasn't happy with my approach to the game, but hopefully this blog will help me return to studying and playing competitively.
- __cryptography/ctfs:__ coming from a bachelor's in maths I discovered cryptography and the world of ctfs. I've attended a master's in cryptography and now I help organize ctfs and play them with the amazing team __about:blankets__.
- __web3:__ recently I've started studying web3 security and found it to be much more interesting and complex than I thought. From the outside, I think most people only see the "logical vulnerabilities" part and simplify it as if it is just a matter of spotting a missing reentrancy guard. But in reality what developed with the idea of the blockchain is a completely new world with its own rules and its own complexity. I'm of course still at the very beginning of this study, but willing to learn more (and looking for my first bounty).

There are many more things I would like to explore, but this blog will probably focus on these three, since are the main ones I want to carry on in this period.

## Why this blog?
Lately I've been struggling to pursue my interests, swinging between highs and lows and not being able to focus on a goal for long enough. This will be my personal diary where I will keep note of what I'm doing, what I've learned and how my journey is going. But then why make it public? I don't know if anyone will ever read this blog, but in case someone does and wants to share some thoughts on a post, discuss about a chess game, a ctf challenge or anything else, feel free to contact me wherever you want. 

## Why complexity?
This is a concept I've steped onto many times recently and in many different areas. The more obvious ones are chess and maths, but you can recognize very similar characteristics in the complexity that arises from the interactions of Ethereum contracts, or from the composition of classical music or even from the relationships between people. But what is the definition of complexity? How do we interact with it? Can we study it? These are all questions I would like to answer one day, or at least try to. And I hope to find the answer during this journey.

Well, I guess this is it for now.

To be contintinued.
