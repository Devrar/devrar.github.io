Welcome back! I have to admit, writing a post for every game is not easy, but it forces me to analyse and study it, so it is definitely worth it. And I hope you are appreciating this too!

Where were we? Last game was the amazing King's Indian that unfortunately ended in a loss, so I'm at 2/3. I know it will be hard to reach the podium at this point, but all I care in the end is to play some good games.

## The game

For the fourth round I'm White against Sebastiano Ripani, a very young player - only 9 y/o! - with an Elo of 1739. But don't let the rating fool you, these young players are much stronger than their Elo; indeed on the third round my opponent beat a 2000 Elo player!

As usual, here is the game and then the analysis. I'm sorry you always have to scroll up and down to see the moves, for the next tournaments I'll try to find a better setup.

### The opening

As always I open with **1. e4** and my opponent answers with **1. ... c5**, the Sicilian, and my weapon against it is the Alapin with **2. c3**. At the highest level the Alapin has the reputation of a drawish opening, but obviously at our level it is perfectly valid for a good fight. Moreover it is the recommendation of both Naroditsky and Boraso, my two main sources of opening theory, so there’s no doubt I’ll keep playing it for a while.

At {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="15" >}}move 7{{</ go-to-move >}} I'm used to the line **7... Bxf3 8. Nxd5 Bxd1 9. Nc7+ Kd8 10. Nxa8 Bh5**, which I've always found more playable for White than for Black, but my opponent went for **7. ... Qa5**, which seems reasonable to me. In these positions White often has **d5** which is very strong, but here after **8. d5 Rd8** I didn't find a good response.

So the game continued with normal development **8. Be2 e6 9. O-O Nf6 10. h3** and {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="30" >}}here{{</ go-to-move >}} my opponent chose to take the knight on **f3** instead of **Bh5**, which I was very happy to see.

The opening finished at {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="38" >}}move 14{{</ go-to-move >}} where Black developed his rooks in the centre and I have to make a decision for the next move.


### The middlegame

I'm quite happy with how I played the middlegame, since here I found a plan that I think makes sense - I didn't look at it with the engine yet, so we will discover it together. In these kinds of positions, with the IQP - Isolated Queen Pawn - I know two main plans: setting up an attack on the kingside or playing for **d5**.

The attack didn't seem doable in this game, so I waited for the right moment to push on **d5**, which is definitely not now - I guess. So my idea was pushing the pawns on the queenside, using the exposed position of the queen to gain some tempi, and trying to put a knight on **c5**. So the game went on with **15. a3 a6 16. b4 Qc7 17. Rac1 Qb8**.

{{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="44" >}}At this point{{</ go-to-move >}} comes a crucial moment of the game. Here I thought for a while, contemplating the manoeuvre **18. Na4** followed by **19. Nb3**, which seemed very strong, but then I spotted a very cool response for Black on **18. Na4**, that wins him a pawn. Can you find it? Well, it is included in the variations on the board above, but don't look at it!

I felt that the position should be a bit better for White, but neither **18. Ne4** or **18. Na4** looked good, so how to continue? Then the idea came: if nothing else works but it feels like I'm better, it must mean it's the right moment for **d5**! Indeed, after **18. d5 exd5 19. Nxd5 Nxd5 20. Bxd5 Bf6 21. Ba2 Re8 22. Qg4 g6** I'm very happy of my light-squared bishop on **a2**, my active queen and the pressure I have on Black's position. Objectively I think the evaluation is almost equal, but it looks good for White.

The game continued with me trying to put pressure on **f7** and improving the position of my pieces, until we reached {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="72" >}}move 28{{</ go-to-move >}} where I proposed a queen trade. As soon as I played it I regretted it: I was afraid that, after the trade, the pawn on g3 would have been too weak, but actually after **28... Qxg3 29. fxg3 Be5 30. Rd7** it looks very good for White - but we will ask the oracle later.

Instead, the trade happened a few moves later after **28. ... Be5 29. Qg4 Nd8 30. Qd7 Qxd7 31. Rxd7** entering an endgame where I'm much more active.


### The endgame

{{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="83" >}}Once the queens were traded{{</ go-to-move >}} I was pretty sure my position was much better: the bishops are very strong and Black's position is too passive, but converting this into a win is a different story.

Luckily my opponent made it easier, because after a few moves, once I entered with the bishops, he missed a tactic that won me a full piece. Try to find it at {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="92" >}}move 35{{</ go-to-move >}}!

At this point the rest of the game was easy, creating a passed pawn and pushing it thanks to my extra piece. I just needed to pay attention to some tricks, like the one at {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="100" >}}move 39{{</ go-to-move >}}, where if I defend with the natural **40. Rd2?** Black has the amazing **40. ... Rc7!** winning back the piece!


## Was the analysis correct?

Moment of truth, let's see what Stockfish has to say about this game.

Ok, first cold shower: after **7. ... Qa5**, **8. d5** was not only very strong, but basically winning! The evaluation is +2.7! The response after **8. ... Rd8** is just **9. Bd2** and, if Black tries to get ambitious with **9. ... Ne5** putting pressure on the pin, White can just sacrifice the queen to get a ton of pieces back: **10. Nxe5! Bxd1  11. Bb5+ Rd7  12. Bxd7+ Kd8  13. Rxd1**. Now that I look at it I remember I saw this variation once, I hope I won't forget it again!

But let's go on with the game. Do you remember when I said that was the right moment for pushing **d5**? Well, it was not. But it almost was. In {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="45" >}}this position{{</ go-to-move >}}, the problem is that Black can respond with **18. ... Ne5** and my bishop on **f3** is a bit embarrassed. So the engine likes to first play **18. g3** and then pushing on **d5** the next move, so that the bishop can retreat on **g2**. Well done engine, you are very smart...

That queen trade I proposed on **g3** at {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="72" >}}move 28{{</ go-to-move >}} was actually bad: the variation I analysed is not the correct one for Black; if, instead of **29. ... Be5** Black plays **29. ... Rd8** trading the rooks, the position is equal.

The rest of the game is not bad until {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="88" >}}move 33{{</ go-to-move >}}. As I said, here I know I'm much better, but finding the correct continuation is not easy. In this position it's important to play **34. Bf6**, not only to clamp down on Black's position, but mainly to prevent the counterplay with **34. ... Be5** and **35. ... Bb2** attacking White's pawns on the queenside. Instead I decided to infiltrate with the light-squared bishop, but after **34. Bd5 Be5  35. Bb7 Bb2** I lose a great share of the advantage.

Final gem from the engine, the trick at {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="100" >}}move 39{{</ go-to-move >}} where I could lose a piece is not a real trick. Try to solve it, {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="104" >}}here{{</ go-to-move >}} White to move and save the piece!

## Conclusion

I liked this game, I was very concentrated the whole time and felt the position was under control. It's true that there are many inaccuracies, but that's more than understandable at this level. Moreover I didn't get overwhelmed by the fact that my opponent was just 9 years old, which - trust me - is not easy at all!

I'll try to make the last post tonight, but maybe I will fall asleep before, so I can't guarantee anything.
