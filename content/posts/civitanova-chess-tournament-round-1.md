Welcome back! I know, it's been a long time since my last post, but finding the time to write isn't easy. Anyway, right now I'm back home in Marche for a few days and took the opportunity to play a chess tournament in Civitanova. Actually, I also played a tournament in Recco (Liguria) a couple of weeks ago and wanted to make a post about it, but didn't have the time. However it went very badly, so you didn't miss anything.

## The game

In this round I played against Luca Lombardi, a 2N with 1671 elo, with the black pieces. Here you can scroll through the game for a first look, but in the next sections I will try to analyse the different phases in detail. The first analysis will be without the engine, then I will ask the divine oracle if my analysis makes sense or not.

### The opening

He opened with **1. d4**, against which I always play the King's Indian Defence. He entered a line I had never seen, with **2. Nf3**, **3. e3** and **4. b3**, while I played the normal KID moves. So, not knowing what was going on, at {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="10" >}}move 4{{</ go-to-move >}} I went for **4. ... c5**, trying to open up the diagonal for my bishop on g7, but after **5. Bb2 cxd4 6. Bxd4 Nc6 7. Bb2 d6 8. Be2 O-O 9. O-O b6 10. Nbd2 Bb7** we reached {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="22" >}}this position{{</ go-to-move >}}. Here I said "Ok, I'm a bit afraid of the dark-squared bishops staring at each other, but I like my bishop on b7, my knights are controlling well the center and I have the half-open c file where I can put my rook" - well, I didn't say it loud, but I thought it.

At this point my opponent pulled out a maneuver which I recognized and it scared me quite a lot.

### The middlegame

It is said that "the middlegame starts when the memory of the players ends". In that case it should have started at move 4 for me. But I guess this is a more adequate point where we can talk about middle game.

We were talking about the scary maneuver from my opponent. That maneuver was **11. a3**, **12. Ra2** and I guess it should have ended with **Qa1**, with the idea of creating a strong battery with bishop and queen on that diagonal. But, instead of Qa1, at {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="29" >}}move 14{{</ go-to-move >}} he played **14. Qb1**. For a moment I thought he had misclicked in real life. I don't know what the idea was. Maybe playing for e4? Or for Ne4? But after **15. Ne4** there would have been **15. ... Nxe4 16. Bxg7 Kxg7 17. Qxe4 Nb4 18. Qd4+ e5 19. Qb2 Nxa2 20. Qxa2** winning the exchange. So I went for a stupid plan — though I think it scared my opponent more than it should. I thought "If you are not going to build the battery with queen and bishop, I will!" and proceeded to play **14. ... Ba8** and **15. ... Qb7**, which provoked my opponent to play **16. Ne1**.

Since the battery at that point was useless, I moved the queen to d7, which this time provoked the other knight to retreat with **17. Nf1** - even though I don't think it was that necessary. At this point I evaluated my position as slightly better and pondered for a while about the next move. Finally, I decided for **17. ... Qe6**, thinking it was a good position for the queen, controlling e4 and putting pressure on c4 and b3, with some ideas of Na5.

After **18. Bf3 Na5  19. Bc3** we arrived {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="51" >}}here{{</ go-to-move >}} and I thought it was the right moment to play d5. The game continued with **20. Bxa5 bxa5 21. c5 Ne4**, which was the continuation I was hoping for: it is true that white has a passed pawn on c5, but I thought my bishop on g7, the knight on e4 and the fact that the white knights are so undeveloped were a very good compensation.

Unfortunately, at this point my opponent blundered an exchange with **22. b4 Nc3 23. Qc2 Nxa2 24. Qxa2**, so for the rest of the game I just tried to contain the passed pawn, exchange some pieces and get in an endgame with an exchange up.

### The endgame

At {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="96" >}}move 41{{</ go-to-move >}} we finally arrived at an endgame which should be fairly easy for black. My technique was far from optimal but somehow I got the job done and managed to pull out the win for the first round!


## What the almighty engine says

Time for the big reveal: how many blunders did I make? Was the game complete trash? Luckily we have an engine to answer these questions and break our self-confidence!

First of all, the opening. It actually went pretty well: **4. ... c5** was the correct response, but after the exchange I should have played the more ambitious **7. ... d5** instead of the timid **d6**. I thought about it during the game, but I felt it was a bit too much. Looking at it afterwards, there is really no reason for not taking the center at this point.

The rest of the game was always more or less equal until {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="51" >}}move 19{{</ go-to-move >}}, where I'm very happy I understood the position correctly and after **19. ... c5 20. Bxa5 bxa5 21. c5 Ne4** black is actually better with about -0.9.

After I won the exchange everything went very smoothly and I managed to keep my advantage without any surprises.

Ah ah - got you? I completely blundered the game at {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="90" >}}move 38{{</ go-to-move >}}! But my opponent didn't notice, so all's well that ends well! Try to find the sequence that gives white the advantage. To my - and my opponent's - defense, it is really a crazy line, very hard to spot on the board, at least at our level.


## Conclusion

Overall I'm quite happy with the game, especially after the last tournament where I didn't win a single one. Probably something could have been better, but it's a good start. See you tomorrow with games 2 and 3!
