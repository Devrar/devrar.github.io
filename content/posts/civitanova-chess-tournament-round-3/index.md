Welcome back! Are you ready for a crazy King's Indian game? This is the third round of the tournament, I'm at 2/2 on board two and I need a win to stay on top of the leaderboard.

## The Game

I'm against Leonardo Renzetti, a player about my age but almost 100 rating points higher, at 2020 ELO. I've already analysed the game with an engine with him after we finished, but this time the vibes mean much more than engine's evaluation.

### The opening

The opening is a pure King's Indian Defense, Mar del Plata variation. It is pure theory up until {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="27" >}}move 14{{</ go-to-move >}} - well, for my opponent it was up until {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="39" >}}move 19{{</ go-to-move >}}, I think. During lunch - read the previous post for more information - I was stalking my opponent on Chess.com and I found out he plays **a4** in this position. I've studied it with the engine and with Black the engine likes to play with **a5**, **b6** and trying to stop the attack on the queenside. However during the game, after thinking for a while, I opted for a traditional approach, focusing on the attack on the kingside.

At {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="35" >}}move 17{{</ go-to-move >}} we arrive at a big moment for the game. As said before, this is still theory and the best move is **g3**, but I went for the spicier variation **17. ... Ng6  18. Nxa7** and now I sacrificed...

{{< /spoiler >}}

and proceeded to play **18. ... Rxa7!** The exclamation mark is mine, the engine gives +2.2 for White :(
But, as I said, this game is about vibes and not evaluation and I think the vibe was good for a tipical King's Indian attack!

### The middlegame

Let's continue with the attack! **19. Bxa7 g3  20. Kh1 h4 21. Bb6 Qe8 22. a6**. Ok, {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="45" >}}here{{</ go-to-move >}} it is important to give White's attack some credit, because that **a**-pawn is very scary. Fortunately I got an idea which turned out working pretty well: taking on **a6**, then pushing on **h3** and letting White take my bishop on **c8**. This way we got into {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="52" >}}this position{{</ go-to-move >}} and here the engine gives -0.5! Our attack is starting to give some results and now White has to defend: **26. Bg1 Qh3 27. Qc2**.

{{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="55" >}}This{{</ go-to-move >}} is maybe the most crucial moment in the game. Continuing the attack isn't easy and here Black should be very calm and slowly bringing pieces into the attack: **27... Nh5 28. Ra3 Nh4 29. Nxh4 g2+ 30. Qxg2 Ng3+ 31. Qxg3 fxg3 32. Ng2**. This is the engine line and yes, after looking at it makes a lot of sense.

But, once again, this is a game of vibes and the vibe was... {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="56" >}}**Ng4!**{{</ go-to-move >}} Sacrificing a full piece to open the **f**-file and push the pawn. After **28. fxg4 f3 29. Rxf3 Rxf3 30. Ra8+ Kh7** I thought the game was mine: {{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="73" >}}here{{</ go-to-move >}} the threat of **Rf2** is huge, but White has a very strong defensive move, can you find it?

Unfortunately my opponent did: **31. Ra3!** I cannot play **Rf2** because it follows **32. Rxg3 Qxg3  33. Qxf2** and I'm down 2 pawns with no attack remaining. But I kept playing correctly: **31. ... gxh2 32. Bf2 Nf4 33. Ne3**.

{{< go-to-move id="ct-1" move="78" >}}This{{</ go-to-move >}} is the last important moment of the game. Let's review what happened in the last few moves: I first sacrificed an exchange, started building an attack on the kingside, sacrificed a whole knight, thought I was winning and my opponent pulled out some incredible defensive moves. I knew that the power of the attack was fading out and felt like this had to be the right moment to find the final blow. Yes, this was a game of vibes, but unfortunately chess is not.

I miscalculated a line and thought **33. ... Rxe3** was working. But when I played it I realized the error and knew the game was gone. No "look away and whistle" strategy this time, the only move for White is to take the rook and I don't have a follow-up.

I played a few more moves trying to find some tricks in the attack with queen and bishop, but there was nothing and I resigned soon after.

## Conclusion

What a game! The end was unfortunate, I rushed and didn't manage the complexity of the position, but the journey was amazing. It was my first game in a pure King's Indian Defense and I loved it! There is still a lot to work on, handling an attack like this is not easy, and most of the time, if you don't carry it out successfully, you are just lost. But I hope I'll bring more games like this, maybe with a different result.

See you tomorrow with the final two rounds of the tournament!
