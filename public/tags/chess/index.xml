      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome back! I was writing a post on a chess tournament I played around a month ago, but in the end I decided to postpone it and instead focus first on what has been my journey and where I am now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This will be a very personal post. Forgive me for the drastic change of tone there will be at some point, but to talk about the last part, I also wanted to talk about my past and this was the only way I could do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
