      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome back! I know, it&amp;rsquo;s been a long time since my last post, but finding the time to write isn&amp;rsquo;t easy. Anyway, right now I&amp;rsquo;m back home in Marche for a few days and took the opportunity to play a chess tournament in Civitanova. Actually, I also played a tournament in Recco (Liguria) a couple of weeks ago and wanted to make a post about it, but didn&amp;rsquo;t have the time. However it went very badly, so you didn&amp;rsquo;t miss anything.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Welcome back! I was writing a post on a chess tournament I played around a month ago, but in the end I decided to postpone it and instead focus first on what has been my journey and where I am now.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This will be a very personal post. Forgive me for the drastic change of tone there will be at some point, but to talk about the last part, I also wanted to talk about my past and this was the only way I could do it.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
