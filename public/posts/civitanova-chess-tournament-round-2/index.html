        <p>Welcome back! Already here for round 2? This morning it was a quick game, so I should manage to publish this before the third round.</p>
<h2 id="the-game">The game</h2>
<p>This time I had the white pieces against Corrado Luberti, a player at his very first tournament! I talked to him a little bit after the game and he confessed he doesn&rsquo;t really like thinking too much at every move, but he wanted to give it a try anyway. Honestly I also wasn&rsquo;t really in the mood to spend too much time, since today it is my brother&rsquo;s birthday - 🥳🥳 - and we will go out for lunch - oh no, I still have only 20 minutes to write this post 😱.</p>
<p>Anyway, as usual, you can see the whole game down here and then I will make the analysis step by step. This time I&rsquo;ve already scrolled it with the engine together with my opponent, but I will try to give you my honest thoughts during the game and integrate it with Stockfish&rsquo;s evaluation.</p>

<h3 id="the-opening">The opening</h3>
<p>I was hoping for a Caro-Kann, since against it I always play the fantasy variation, which for inexperienced players is very dangerous - remember, I was aiming for a quick game. But at <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '8');
   return false;">
  move 3</a> he played <strong>Nf6</strong> and once again I was out of theory very soon. It&rsquo;s true I&rsquo;ve seen it many times online, but I&rsquo;ve never studied this move so I don&rsquo;t know exactly what to play. After a while I thought that playing <strong>4. e5</strong>, entering a french structure and just enjoying my space advantage couldn&rsquo;t be a bad move - <em>the engine approves</em>.</p>
<p>For a while I also considered going <strong>e6</strong>, for example a <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '14');
   return false;">
  move 6</a>, to provoke <strong>fxe6</strong> and play against his weak <strong>e</strong>-pawn, but it felt wrong - <em>the engine agrees with this too</em>.</p>
<p>So the opening went well until <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '19');
   return false;">
  move 9</a>. As soon as I played it I saw it was a blunder, because after <strong>9&hellip; cxd4 10. cxd4 Ndxe5</strong> black gains a clean pawn. The only thing I could do was implementing the good old strategy &ldquo;look away and whistle&rdquo; - illustrative gif below.</p>
<p><img src="monkey-d-luffy-whistle.gif" alt=""></p>
<p>It worked like a charm, my opponent played <strong>9. &hellip; Be7</strong>, I went <strong>10. Kh1</strong> and the game went on.</p>
<h3 id="the-middlegame">The middlegame</h3>
<p>My idea was to push the <strong>f</strong> pawn, opening up his king and mating him - very clear plan and very optimistic. But it kinda worked.</p>
<p>After <strong>11. f4 cxd4 12. cxd4 Nb4 13. Bb3</strong> my opponent pushed <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '32');
   return false;">
  <strong>f6</strong></a>. Even though it is a standard plan in these structures, in this exact position it felt a bit risky for him: my bishop on <strong>b3</strong> is pointing at his king and my pawn is ready to strike with <strong>f5</strong>. But it felt too soon to go <strong>f5</strong> so I first went for <strong>Nc3</strong> developing a piece - <em>the engine more or less agrees with that</em>.</p>
<p>But, after <strong>14. &hellip; Nb8</strong>, <strong>f5</strong> was calling and I played it without thinking too much - like the whole game in the end. It is actually very strong, since at this point the problems on the <strong>a2 - g8</strong> diagonal are too big to handle and black is too undeveloped.</p>
<p>After <strong>15. &hellip; fxe5 16. dxe5 Bd7</strong> I went for <strong>17. Nd4</strong>, to increase the pressure on <strong>e6</strong> and bringing another piece into the attack - <em>the engine does not agree</em>. Apparently this spoils a big share of the advantage after <strong>17. &hellip; Nc6</strong>. The biggest problem is that I was preparing to play <strong>18. Nxe6 Bxe6 19. fxe6 Rxf1+ 20. Qxf1 Rf8 21. Qd1 Nxe5</strong> <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '50');
   return false;">
  after which</a> Black is almost winning!</p>
<p>But luckily we didn&rsquo;t go into any of these variations, since my opponent played <strong>17. &hellip; Bc5</strong> and now <strong>18. fxe6</strong> is winning, especially after <strong>18. &hellip; Bxd4 19. Rxf8+ Kxf8 20. Qf1+ Kg8 21. Qf7+ Kh8 22. Qf8#</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Not the cleanest game, but it&rsquo;s understandable once you consider that my opponent is used to short-time chess and I wanted to finish early to go to lunch. When we talked after the game we also discussed about long-time chess and how top-level players are pushing for shorter time controls.</p>
<p>Is long-time chess dying? Will there be only short-time tournaments at some point? I don&rsquo;t think so, the complexity of the game is so high that there will always be people willing to spend hours and hours for a single game.</p>
<p>Now sorry but I have to go to lunch, see you this evening for round 3!</p>
