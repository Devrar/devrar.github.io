        <p>Welcome back! I have to admit, writing a post for every game is not easy, but it forces me to analyse and study it, so it is definitely worth it. And I hope you are appreciating this too!</p>
<p>Where were we? Last game was the amazing King&rsquo;s Indian that unfortunately ended in a loss, so I&rsquo;m at 2/3. I know it will be hard to reach the podium at this point, but all I care in the end is to play some good games.</p>
<h2 id="the-game">The game</h2>
<p>For the fourth round I&rsquo;m White against Sebastiano Ripani, a very young player - only 9 y/o! - with an Elo of 1739. But don&rsquo;t let the rating fool you, these young players are much stronger than their Elo; indeed on the third round my opponent beat a 2000 Elo player!</p>
<p>As usual, here is the game and then the analysis. I&rsquo;m sorry you always have to scroll up and down to see the moves, for the next tournaments I&rsquo;ll try to find a better setup.</p>

<h3 id="the-opening">The opening</h3>
<p>As always I open with <strong>1. e4</strong> and my opponent answers with <strong>1. &hellip; c5</strong>, the Sicilian, and my weapon against it is the Alapin with <strong>2. c3</strong>. At the highest level the Alapin has the reputation of a drawish opening, but obviously at our level it is perfectly valid for a good fight. Moreover it is the recommendation of both Naroditsky and Boraso, my two main sources of opening theory, so there’s no doubt I’ll keep playing it for a while.</p>
<p>At <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '15');
   return false;">
  move 7</a> I&rsquo;m used to the line <strong>7&hellip; Bxf3 8. Nxd5 Bxd1 9. Nc7+ Kd8 10. Nxa8 Bh5</strong>, which I&rsquo;ve always found more playable for White than for Black, but my opponent went for <strong>7. &hellip; Qa5</strong>, which seems reasonable to me. In these positions White often has <strong>d5</strong> which is very strong, but here after <strong>8. d5 Rd8</strong> I didn&rsquo;t find a good response.</p>
<p>So the game continued with normal development <strong>8. Be2 e6 9. O-O Nf6 10. h3</strong> and <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '30');
   return false;">
  here</a> my opponent chose to take the knight on <strong>f3</strong> instead of <strong>Bh5</strong>, which I was very happy to see.</p>
<p>The opening finished at <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '38');
   return false;">
  move 14</a> where Black developed his rooks in the centre and I have to make a decision for the next move.</p>
<h3 id="the-middlegame">The middlegame</h3>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite happy with how I played the middlegame, since here I found a plan that I think makes sense - I didn&rsquo;t look at it with the engine yet, so we will discover it together. In these kinds of positions, with the IQP - Isolated Queen Pawn - I know two main plans: setting up an attack on the kingside or playing for <strong>d5</strong>.</p>
<p>The attack didn&rsquo;t seem doable in this game, so I waited for the right moment to push on <strong>d5</strong>, which is definitely not now - I guess. So my idea was pushing the pawns on the queenside, using the exposed position of the queen to gain some tempi, and trying to put a knight on <strong>c5</strong>. So the game went on with <strong>15. a3 a6 16. b4 Qc7 17. Rac1 Qb8</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '44');
   return false;">
  At this point</a> comes a crucial moment of the game. Here I thought for a while, contemplating the manoeuvre <strong>18. Na4</strong> followed by <strong>19. Nb3</strong>, which seemed very strong, but then I spotted a very cool response for Black on <strong>18. Na4</strong>, that wins him a pawn. Can you find it? Well, it is included in the variations on the board above, but don&rsquo;t look at it!</p>
<p>I felt that the position should be a bit better for White, but neither <strong>18. Ne4</strong> or <strong>18. Na4</strong> looked good, so how to continue? Then the idea came: if nothing else works but it feels like I&rsquo;m better, it must mean it&rsquo;s the right moment for <strong>d5</strong>! Indeed, after <strong>18. d5 exd5 19. Nxd5 Nxd5 20. Bxd5 Bf6 21. Ba2 Re8 22. Qg4 g6</strong> I&rsquo;m very happy of my light-squared bishop on <strong>a2</strong>, my active queen and the pressure I have on Black&rsquo;s position. Objectively I think the evaluation is almost equal, but it looks good for White.</p>
<p>The game continued with me trying to put pressure on <strong>f7</strong> and improving the position of my pieces, until we reached <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '72');
   return false;">
  move 28</a> where I proposed a queen trade. As soon as I played it I regretted it: I was afraid that, after the trade, the pawn on g3 would have been too weak, but actually after <strong>28&hellip; Qxg3 29. fxg3 Be5 30. Rd7</strong> it looks very good for White - but we will ask the oracle later.</p>
<p>Instead, the trade happened a few moves later after <strong>28. &hellip; Be5 29. Qg4 Nd8 30. Qd7 Qxd7 31. Rxd7</strong> entering an endgame where I&rsquo;m much more active.</p>
<h3 id="the-endgame">The endgame</h3>
<p><a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '83');
   return false;">
  Once the queens were traded</a> I was pretty sure my position was much better: the bishops are very strong and Black&rsquo;s position is too passive, but converting this into a win is a different story.</p>
<p>Luckily my opponent made it easier, because after a few moves, once I entered with the bishops, he missed a tactic that won me a full piece. Try to find it at <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '92');
   return false;">
  move 35</a>!</p>
<p>At this point the rest of the game was easy, creating a passed pawn and pushing it thanks to my extra piece. I just needed to pay attention to some tricks, like the one at <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '100');
   return false;">
  move 39</a>, where if I defend with the natural <strong>40. Rd2?</strong> Black has the amazing <strong>40. &hellip; Rc7!</strong> winning back the piece!</p>
<h2 id="was-the-analysis-correct">Was the analysis correct?</h2>
<p>Moment of truth, let&rsquo;s see what Stockfish has to say about this game.</p>
<p>Ok, first cold shower: after <strong>7. &hellip; Qa5</strong>, <strong>8. d5</strong> was not only very strong, but basically winning! The evaluation is +2.7! The response after <strong>8. &hellip; Rd8</strong> is just <strong>9. Bd2</strong> and, if Black tries to get ambitious with <strong>9. &hellip; Ne5</strong> putting pressure on the pin, White can just sacrifice the queen to get a ton of pieces back: <strong>10. Nxe5! Bxd1  11. Bb5+ Rd7  12. Bxd7+ Kd8  13. Rxd1</strong>. Now that I look at it I remember I saw this variation once, I hope I won&rsquo;t forget it again!</p>
<p>But let&rsquo;s go on with the game. Do you remember when I said that was the right moment for pushing <strong>d5</strong>? Well, it was not. But it almost was. In <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '45');
   return false;">
  this position</a>, the problem is that Black can respond with <strong>18. &hellip; Ne5</strong> and my bishop on <strong>f3</strong> is a bit embarrassed. So the engine likes to first play <strong>18. g3</strong> and then pushing on <strong>d5</strong> the next move, so that the bishop can retreat on <strong>g2</strong>. Well done engine, you are very smart&hellip;</p>
<p>That queen trade I proposed on <strong>g3</strong> at <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '72');
   return false;">
  move 28</a> was actually bad: the variation I analysed is not the correct one for Black; if, instead of <strong>29. &hellip; Be5</strong> Black plays <strong>29. &hellip; Rd8</strong> trading the rooks, the position is equal.</p>
<p>The rest of the game is not bad until <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '88');
   return false;">
  move 33</a>. As I said, here I know I&rsquo;m much better, but finding the correct continuation is not easy. In this position it&rsquo;s important to play <strong>34. Bf6</strong>, not only to clamp down on Black&rsquo;s position, but mainly to prevent the counterplay with <strong>34. &hellip; Be5</strong> and <strong>35. &hellip; Bb2</strong> attacking White&rsquo;s pawns on the queenside. Instead I decided to infiltrate with the light-squared bishop, but after <strong>34. Bd5 Be5  35. Bb7 Bb2</strong> I lose a great share of the advantage.</p>
<p>Final gem from the engine, the trick at <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '100');
   return false;">
  move 39</a> where I could lose a piece is not a real trick. Try to solve it, <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '104');
   return false;">
  here</a> White to move and save the piece!</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>I liked this game, I was very concentrated the whole time and felt the position was under control. It&rsquo;s true that there are many inaccuracies, but that&rsquo;s more than understandable at this level. Moreover I didn&rsquo;t get overwhelmed by the fact that my opponent was just 9 years old, which - trust me - is not easy at all!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ll try to make the last post tonight, but maybe I will fall asleep before, so I can&rsquo;t guarantee anything.</p>
