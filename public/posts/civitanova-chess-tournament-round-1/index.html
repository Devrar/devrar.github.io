        <p>Welcome back! I know, it&rsquo;s been a long time since my last post, but finding the time to write isn&rsquo;t easy. Anyway, right now I&rsquo;m back home in Marche for a few days and took the opportunity to play a chess tournament in Civitanova. Actually, I also played a tournament in Recco (Liguria) a couple of weeks ago and wanted to make a post about it, but didn&rsquo;t have the time. However it went very badly, so you didn&rsquo;t miss anything.</p>
<h2 id="the-game">The game</h2>
<p>In this round I played against Luca Lombardi, a 2N with 1671 elo, with the black pieces. Here you can scroll through the game for a first look, but in the next sections I will try to analyse the different phases in detail. The first analysis will be without the engine, then I will ask the divine oracle if my analysis makes sense or not.</p>

<h3 id="the-opening">The opening</h3>
<p>He opened with <strong>1. d4</strong>, against which I always play the King&rsquo;s Indian Defence. He entered a line I had never seen, with <strong>2. Nf3</strong>, <strong>3. e3</strong> and <strong>4. b3</strong>, while I played the normal KID moves. So, not knowing what was going on, at <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '10');
   return false;">
  move 4</a> I went for <strong>4. &hellip; c5</strong>, trying to open up the diagonal for my bishop on g7, but after <strong>5. Bb2 cxd4 6. Bxd4 Nc6 7. Bb2 d6 8. Be2 O-O 9. O-O b6 10. Nbd2 Bb7</strong> we reached <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '22');
   return false;">
  this position</a>. Here I said &ldquo;Ok, I&rsquo;m a bit afraid of the dark-squared bishops staring at each other, but I like my bishop on b7, my knights are controlling well the center and I have the half-open c file where I can put my rook&rdquo; - well, I didn&rsquo;t say it loud, but I thought it.</p>
<p>At this point my opponent pulled out a maneuver which I recognized and it scared me quite a lot.</p>
<h3 id="the-middlegame">The middlegame</h3>
<p>It is said that &ldquo;the middlegame starts when the memory of the players ends&rdquo;. In that case it should have started at move 4 for me. But I guess this is a more adequate point where we can talk about middle game.</p>
<p>We were talking about the scary maneuver from my opponent. That maneuver was <strong>11. a3</strong>, <strong>12. Ra2</strong> and I guess it should have ended with <strong>Qa1</strong>, with the idea of creating a strong battery with bishop and queen on that diagonal. But, instead of Qa1, at <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '29');
   return false;">
  move 14</a> he played <strong>14. Qb1</strong>. For a moment I thought he had misclicked in real life. I don&rsquo;t know what the idea was. Maybe playing for e4? Or for Ne4? But after <strong>15. Ne4</strong> there would have been <strong>15. &hellip; Nxe4 16. Bxg7 Kxg7 17. Qxe4 Nb4 18. Qd4+ e5 19. Qb2 Nxa2 20. Qxa2</strong> winning the exchange. So I went for a stupid plan — though I think it scared my opponent more than it should. I thought &ldquo;If you are not going to build the battery with queen and bishop, I will!&rdquo; and proceeded to play <strong>14. &hellip; Ba8</strong> and <strong>15. &hellip; Qb7</strong>, which provoked my opponent to play <strong>16. Ne1</strong>.</p>
<p>Since the battery at that point was useless, I moved the queen to d7, which this time provoked the other knight to retreat with <strong>17. Nf1</strong> - even though I don&rsquo;t think it was that necessary. At this point I evaluated my position as slightly better and pondered for a while about the next move. Finally, I decided for <strong>17. &hellip; Qe6</strong>, thinking it was a good position for the queen, controlling e4 and putting pressure on c4 and b3, with some ideas of Na5.</p>
<p>After <strong>18. Bf3 Na5  19. Bc3</strong> we arrived <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '51');
   return false;">
  here</a> and I thought it was the right moment to play d5. The game continued with <strong>20. Bxa5 bxa5 21. c5 Ne4</strong>, which was the continuation I was hoping for: it is true that white has a passed pawn on c5, but I thought my bishop on g7, the knight on e4 and the fact that the white knights are so undeveloped were a very good compensation.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, at this point my opponent blundered an exchange with <strong>22. b4 Nc3 23. Qc2 Nxa2 24. Qxa2</strong>, so for the rest of the game I just tried to contain the passed pawn, exchange some pieces and get in an endgame with an exchange up.</p>
<h3 id="the-endgame">The endgame</h3>
<p>At <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '96');
   return false;">
  move 41</a> we finally arrived at an endgame which should be fairly easy for black. My technique was far from optimal but somehow I got the job done and managed to pull out the win for the first round!</p>
<h2 id="what-the-almighty-engine-says">What the almighty engine says</h2>
<p>Time for the big reveal: how many blunders did I make? Was the game complete trash? Luckily we have an engine to answer these questions and break our self-confidence!</p>
<p>First of all, the opening. It actually went pretty well: <strong>4. &hellip; c5</strong> was the correct response, but after the exchange I should have played the more ambitious <strong>7. &hellip; d5</strong> instead of the timid <strong>d6</strong>. I thought about it during the game, but I felt it was a bit too much. Looking at it afterwards, there is really no reason for not taking the center at this point.</p>
<p>The rest of the game was always more or less equal until <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '51');
   return false;">
  move 19</a>, where I&rsquo;m very happy I understood the position correctly and after <strong>19. &hellip; c5 20. Bxa5 bxa5 21. c5 Ne4</strong> black is actually better with about -0.9.</p>
<p>After I won the exchange everything went very smoothly and I managed to keep my advantage without any surprises.</p>
<p>Ah ah - got you? I completely blundered the game at <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '90');
   return false;">
  move 38</a>! But my opponent didn&rsquo;t notice, so all&rsquo;s well that ends well! Try to find the sequence that gives white the advantage. To my - and my opponent&rsquo;s - defense, it is really a crazy line, very hard to spot on the board, at least at our level.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>Overall I&rsquo;m quite happy with the game, especially after the last tournament where I didn&rsquo;t win a single one. Probably something could have been better, but it&rsquo;s a good start. See you tomorrow with games 2 and 3!</p>
