        <p>Welcome back! Yesterday I was too tired to write this post, so I&rsquo;m writing it now. This is the final game of the tournament and I&rsquo;m at 3/4 playing on second board and if I manage to win I guarantee a third place! However, fortunately this didn&rsquo;t affect my way to play, I was only focused on playing well.</p>
<h2 id="the-game">The game</h2>
<p>For the final game I&rsquo;m Black against Mauro Di Mantino, a 1984-rated player - and also born in 1984, how cool is that? Here it is the game:</p>

<h3 id="the-opening">The opening</h3>
<p>He played <strong>1. c4</strong>, the English Opening, against which I don&rsquo;t have a clear response. Most of the time I just play the King&rsquo;s Indian moves and pray that I have a reasonable position. Even though it is a naive approach, it&rsquo;s not completely wrong.</p>
<p>So this time I did the same thing until we reached <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '17');
   return false;">
  move 8</a>. I don&rsquo;t know if it is too soon to talk about a middlegame, but I don&rsquo;t care so let&rsquo;s go to the next section.</p>
<h3 id="the-middlegame">The middlegame</h3>
<p>I implemented a standard plan in the King&rsquo;s Indian with <strong>c5</strong>: pushing <strong>a6</strong>, then <strong>b5</strong> and trying to attack on the queenside. My opponent didn&rsquo;t put any resistance to that and let me push on <strong>b5</strong>, while building a battery with queen and bishop.</p>
<p>Now it is time for a philosophical question: is there luck in chess? I hope that this game will convince you that yes, sometimes luck is an important component of a game. Indeed look at <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '23');
   return false;">
  this position</a>. Here I thought for a while and eventually I found a very nice tactical shot that gives me an advantage: <strong>11. &hellip; bxc4 12. dxc4 Ne5</strong> attacking <strong>c4</strong> and if White defends with <strong>12. b3</strong> then <strong>12. &hellip; Bxh3!</strong>, thanks to the tactic <strong>13. Bxh3 Nf3+</strong> forking King and Queen.</p>
<p>I played it and everything went on well until he played <strong>13. f4!</strong>. I didn&rsquo;t see that move and now I&rsquo;m in trouble: if I just follow the line <strong>14&hellip; Bxg2 15. fxe5 Bxf1 16. exf6 Bxf6 17. Rxf1</strong> we end up <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '42');
   return false;">
  here</a> where I have a rook for two pieces and he is well positioned to attack me on the kingside.</p>
<p>But here is where luck comes in! Even though I ended up in a line I didn&rsquo;t consider at all, there is a move that saves me and gives me a clear two-pawn advantage: <strong>14&hellip; Bxg2 15. fxe5 Nxe4! 16. Nxe4 Bxe4</strong> and I&rsquo;m safe.</p>
<p>At this point I need to keep calm and convert my advantage without allowing too much counterplay. I managed to exchange queens quickly with <strong>17. Nc3 Ba8 18. exd6 Qxd6 19. Qxd6 exd6</strong> and now we get into the endgame.</p>
<h3 id="the-endgame">The endgame</h3>
<p>The main thing I didn&rsquo;t like in my position was the backward pawn on <strong>d6</strong>, which is very weak and an easy target for his rooks. Thus I was looking for a way to force his knight on <strong>d5</strong> and exchange it for my light-square bishop, closing the file pointing at my weak pawn.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m quite happy with the plan I pulled out to do this, because it worked very well: <strong>20. &hellip; Rfe8 21. Bf2 Re5 22. Rfd1 Rh5</strong> and <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '56');
   return false;">
  now</a> White is forced to close the diagonal with <strong>23. Nd5</strong>, otherwise the attack on <strong>h1</strong> is too strong. And after <strong>23. &hellip; Bxd5  24. cxd5</strong> my pawn on <strong>d6</strong> is well covered and I don&rsquo;t have to worry about it anymore.</p>
<p>After this problem was solved, I was quite confident I could convert the game. I managed to consolidate my position and at the <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '68');
   return false;">
  right moment</a> I pushed on <strong>c4</strong> to liquidate his queenside pawns, thanks to a pretty tactic after <strong>29. Kf3 cxb3 30. axb3 Rxb3</strong>: <a href="#"
   onclick="
   goToMove('ct-1', '72');
   return false;">
  here</a> my rook on <strong>e4</strong> is hanging, but if <strong>31. Kxe4</strong> then <strong>31. &hellip; f5#</strong> is checkmate! I even tried the secret technique &ldquo;look desperate and hope your opponent falls into it&rdquo;, but it didn&rsquo;t work.</p>
<p><em>Funny story: when I was a kid I managed to make this technique work and play a Legal&rsquo;s Mate on the board! <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6Vm5q2xurtY">Explanation video if you don&rsquo;t know what that is</a></em></p>
<p>Anyway, after a few moves I pinned his bishop and he resigned as there was nothing more to play for.</p>
<h2 id="nothing-else-to-say">Nothing else to say</h2>
<p>This time no big surprises from the engine, my analysis was good apparently. Indeed without <strong>15. &hellip; Nxe4!</strong>, my lucky move, White is slightly better.</p>
<p>One thing I&rsquo;m very proud of is that the plan with <strong>Rfe8, Re5, Rh5</strong> to force <strong>Nd5</strong> was the best one! After that the position is completely winning and I converted it correctly.</p>
<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>
<p>With this win I finished in third place! I&rsquo;m really happy about this tournament, I think I played well and I was always very focused. The only thing I regret is that <strong>Rxe3</strong> blunder on the King&rsquo;s Indian game, but apart from that I&rsquo;m satisfied with my play.</p>
<p>Moreover I&rsquo;m very happy I wrote a post for each game, sharing my thoughts and feelings has been really helpful. So, if you managed to read through all of these, thank you ❤️</p>
